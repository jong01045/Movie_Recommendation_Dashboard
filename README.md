# Movie_Recommendation_Dashboard
Based on the user input, give movies that the user might be interested in.


1. We are gonna build a Machine learning model with this data

   The model is gonna be either a hybrid model or mostly based on Collaborative filtering (CF).
   Then layer in advanced techinques such as deep neural networks or graph-based models.

2. Then we create Tableau dashboards with a several options the user could interact.
   This might include genre, screen time, production nation, director, starring actors

3. Last, we connect this dashboard input with the machine learning models to produce the final recommendation to the dashboard.
